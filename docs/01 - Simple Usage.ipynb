    "# Simple Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Principles\n",
    "The purpose of Maybrain is to allow easy visualisation of brain connectome and related data and perform various analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is built around the class **Brain**. It contains all the information about the brain and numerous functions to change, measure and highlight those. At its heart is a *Networkx* object, Brain.G, via which all *Networkx* functions are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides this main class, you have four packages with other modules, **algorithms**, **plotting**, **utils** and **resources**, which will be explained throughout these notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Input\n",
    "Several types of data can be input. The basic connectome is made up of two files: a coordinate file and an adjacency matrix. In fact only the second of these is strictly required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate file defines the position of each node. It is a text file where each line has four entries: the node index, x, y and z coordinates. e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 0.0 3.1 4.4\n",
    "1 5.3 7.6 8.4\n",
    "2 3.2 4.4 3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix defines the strength of connection between each pair of nodes. For n nodes it is an n Ã— n text matrix. Nodes in maybrain are labelled 0,1,... and the order of the rows and columns in the adjacency matrix is assumed to correspond to this. Entering an adjacency matrix with the wrong dimensions will lead to certain doom."
