    "# Simple Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Principles\n",
    "The purpose of Maybrain is to allow easy visualisation of brain connectome and related data and perform various analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is built around two principal classes, **brainObj** and **plotObj**. The first contains all the information about the brain and numerous functions to change, measure and highlight those. At its heart is a Networkx object, brainObj.G, via which all *Networkx* functions are available. Some have also been incorporated directly into our code for convenience. The **plotObj** class is a wrapper to enable easy plotting using Mayavi2. It can plot several brain objects and subsets of them (highlights) simultaneously and change basic plot properties. Plots are shown in the mayavi GUI for easy access to a whole range of other Mayavi functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Input\n",
    "Several types of data can be input. The basic connectome is made up of two files: a coordinate file and an adjacency matrix. In fact only the second of these is strictly required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate file defines the position of each node. It is a text file where each line has four entries: the node index, x, y and z coordinates. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 0.0 3.1 4.4\n",
    "1 5.3 7.6 8.4\n",
    "2 3.2 4.4 3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix defines the strength of connection between each pair of nodes. For n nodes it is an n Ã— n text matrix. Nodes in maybrain are labelled 0,1,... and the order of the rows and columns in the adjacency matrix is assumed to correspond to this. Entering an adjacency matrix with the wrong dimensions will lead to certain doom."

The advantage of local thresholding is that the graph will always be fully connected, which is necessary to collect some graph measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an absolute threshold you have several possibilities. Note that our adjacency matrix (`a.adjMat`) always stays the same so we can apply all the thresholds we want to create our graph (`a.G`) accordingly. Also notice that we are dealing with a symmetric adjacency matrix, so although out `a.adjMat` will always have the size of 500x500, the `a.G` will not."
